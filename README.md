Code files for senior design

See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KoA2qeiHj3AecPcPePiVI05Ld7mAt6nKuXkNx31tHaM/edit?usp=sharing for information about setting up the Arduino IDE to work with the ESP32 Feather.

Files that start with "sample_" (without quotes) are not intended to be used for the final implementation. They were created during the design process to test for functionality.
